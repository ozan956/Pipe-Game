IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We didn't use file paths to make the code work on everyone's computer. 
Since we do not use paths, it will say that it cannot find txt and png files if run via CMD. 
To prevent this, you can run the files via Eclipse or use the PipeGame.jar file. Also, Pipe
Game.jar file must be stay with other source files to be able to see the assets.
