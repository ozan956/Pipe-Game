## Important Note

We didn't use file paths to make the code work on everyone's computer. 
To prevent this, you can run the files via Eclipse or use the PipeGame.jar file. Also, Pipe
Game.jar file must be stay with other source files to be able to see the assets.
## Problem Definition
The Aim of this game is delivering a ball from start location to the end. To do that, player can 
replace the pipes with dragging mouse. When the correct path constructed, player can play next 
level. 
As shown in Table 1.1, sample game boards constructed 4x4 tiles, each tiles types have some 
specific properties as listed in Table 1.2. The ball always start blue tile and path will end at the 
red tile.
